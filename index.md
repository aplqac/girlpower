# APL STEM: Girl Power!

Welcome message here...

## Bill the Rubber Duck

> Once upon a time, there was a child named Timmy who loved to code. He would spend hours at his computer typing away, creating all sorts of cool programs and games. But sometimes, Timmy would get stuck. He would try and try to fix a bug in his code, but it just wouldn't work.
One day, Timmy's mom gave him a rubber duck named Bill. "Whenever you get stuck, just explain your code to Bill, and he'll help you figure it out," she said.
>
> Timmy was skeptical at first, but he decided to give it a try. He picked up Bill and explained his code to him, line by line. "Okay, Bill, so first I have to set up the variables, and then I need to loop through this array…"
As Timmy talked, he started to see his mistakes. "Oh, I forgot to add this condition to the loop!" he exclaimed.
>
> Bill just quacked and listened patiently as Timmy continued to explain his code. "And then, after the loop, I need to output the results to the screen like this…"
Suddenly, Timmy realized what he had done wrong. "I used the wrong variable name here!" he cried.
> 
> Thanks to Bill, Timmy was able to solve the problem and finish his code. From then on, whenever Timmy got stuck, he would turn to his trusty rubber duck and explain his code to him. And Bill would always listen, never judging, always helping Timmy find the solution he needed.Once upon a time, there was a child named Timmy who loved to code.

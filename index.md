# Bill the Rubber Duck

> Once upon a time, there was a child named Sarah who loved to code. She would spend hours at her computer typing away, creating all sorts of cool programs and games. But sometimes, Sarah would get stuck. She would try and try to fix a bug in her code, but it just wouldn't work.
One day, Sarah's mom gave her a rubber duck named Bill. "Whenever you get stuck, just explain your code to Bill, and he'll help you figure it out," she said.
>
> Sarah was skeptical at first, but she decided to give it a try. She picked up Bill and explained her code to him, line by line. "Okay, Bill, so first I have to set up the variables, and then I need to loop through this array…"
As Sarah talked, she started to see her mistakes. "Oh, I forgot to add this condition to the loop!" she exclaimed.
>
> Bill just quacked and listened patiently as Sarah continued to explain her code. "And then, after the loop, I need to output the results to the screen like this…"
Suddenly, Sarah realized what she had done wrong. "I used the wrong variable name here!" she cried.
> 
> Thanks to Bill, Sarah was able to solve the problem and finish her code. From then on, whenever Sarah got stuck, she would turn to her trusty rubber duck and explain her code to her. And Bill would always listen, never judging, always helping Sarah find the solution she needed.

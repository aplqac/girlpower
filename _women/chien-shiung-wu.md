The first lady of physics. Born in Shanghai, China in 1912, Wu moved to the United States and became a leader in the field of physics. Among her many accomplishments, Wu did important work for the Manhattan Project as well as in experimental physics. However, her key contribution to particle physics, known as the Wu Experiment (named after her!), was ignored by the Nobel Prize committee when it awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics to two other male physicists who worked on the project with her. Despite this slight, she went on to receive many honors during her career, including being only the seventh woman elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1958. In 1990, she even had an asteroid named after her: 2752 Wu Chien-Shiung.

Hamilton helped write the computer code for the command and lunar modules used on the Apollo missions to the moon in the 1960s and 1970s. In fact, she was such a pioneer in the field that she created the term "software engineer" to describe the work she did. Decades since the historic landing, Hamilton was finally recognized for her crucial role in the Apollo 11 mission. On November 22, 2016, President Obama awarded her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, saying Hamilton was a part of "that generation of unsung women who helped send humankind into space."

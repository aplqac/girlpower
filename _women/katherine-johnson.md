Katherine Johnson is one of the first African-American women to work as a NASA scientist, and has become a leading figure in Americaâ€™s aeronautics and space programs. She was known as a "human computer" for her amazing mathematical capability.  She played a major role in calculating trajectories in the 20th century Space Race between the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War.  Her work included calculating the trajectory for the first American in Space, as well as for the 1969 Apollo 11 flights to the moon.  In 2015, President Barack Obama awarded Johnson the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

In 1985, Ellen Ochoa interviewed for the NASA Astronaut program but wasn’t selected.  She kept her application updated and got a pilot license to gain operational experience.  A few years later, she was invited to interview again and was selected to become an astronaut. She made history in 1993 when she became the first Latino woman to go into space. She did so on the Space Shuttle Discovery on a nine-day mission to study the Earth’s ozone layer. Ochoa has spent nearly 1,000 hours in space.  She also became the first Latino and second female director of the Johnson Space Center.

Tu Youyou was born in 1930 in China, and had to take a break from school when she became sick with tuberculosis.  However, because of her experience and recovery, she found her passion in medicine and was determined to help find cures for other diseases.  She studied both traditional Chinese medical texts from the Qing dynasty and Western methods.  During the Vietnam War, many soldiers were dying of malaria in their camps.  With her knowledge, Tu and her team discovered a compound called artemisinin which they extracted from a sweet wormwood plant, described in a Chinese text as a plant for “intermittent fevers”.  This discovery saved not only soldiers but also millions of malaria patients’ lives around the world. In 2015, Tu accepted the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for her work.
